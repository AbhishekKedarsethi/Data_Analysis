1.	üè™Store Performance Optimization 
üß© Problem Statement:
Management aims to compare the revenue and operational performance of each store to identify underperforming locations.
This will help in making data-driven decisions to optimize staffing, resource allocation, and overall operations across stores.
1.	Which stores are top and bottom performers in terms of revenue?
2.	Are there stores consistently underperforming across time?
3.	Is there a relationship between revenue and staffing levels?
4.	What is the average monthly revenue per store?
5.	How do weekday vs. weekend sales compare across stores?

2.	Product Assortment Optimization 
üß© Problem Statement:
Some products are consistently low-performing in terms of sales or have high return rates, while others drive the majority of revenue.
This imbalance suggests the need to optimize the product assortment by identifying top-selling and underperforming products to improve profitability and reduce overhead.
1.	What is our current Gross Profit Margin, and how has it trended over time?

1.	What is the average Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), and which product category drives the highest CLTV?
